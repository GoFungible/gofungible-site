# II - Protect Holders Value
---

## Statement

The token must keep supply integrity according to maker operation. This means that there must not be manipulations on the supply by the token issuer or any third party as these manipulations would create price distortions that can benefit some stakeholder at the expense of another.

## Violating Use Cases

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} 
	 minHeadingLevel={3}
  maxHeadingLevel={3}/>

This requirement makes mandatory a track record of deployed networks per token as well as the supply deployed per network.
