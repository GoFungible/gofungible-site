# I - Capture Value faithfully
---

## Statement

The token must capture the value as claimed. This means that the algorithm to capture the value must be fixed and clearly disclosed.

## Violating Use Cases

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} 
	 minHeadingLevel={3}
  maxHeadingLevel={3}/>

## Solutions

### I - 1. Not having a clear proposition of value

Description 1

### I - 2. Prevent supply manipulations unaligned with the value capture mechanism

Whereas is possible that supply can be operated in order to capture value this operation mechanism must be performed by the token logic itself and therefore embedded in the auditable algorithm.
