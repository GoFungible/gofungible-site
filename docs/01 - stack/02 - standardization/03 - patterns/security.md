# Security Patterns
---

We can classify the Security Policies in 5 levels.

## Access Protection

Access to resources is restricted to specific users or roles.

## Timelock Protection

Access to resources can be delayed by a defined time.

## Consensus Protection

Access to resources must be approved by a percentage of holders.

## Rollback Protection

State of the system is rolled back to a previous date.

## Migration Protection

All or part of the logic of the smart contract is upgraded and state is reverted to a previous date.
